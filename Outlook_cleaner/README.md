# Outlook cleaner

I recently encountered the common problem of running out of storage in my macbook. After doing some digging I realized over 20Gb of my computer were dedicated to downloaded Outlook messages and attachments. Turns out that Outlook doesn't have an option to only download the most recent messages. I figured out that there is no need to keep old messages download them, since I rarely access them, and when I do, I could easily do it from a web browser. 

I have been trying to learn some more Python so I decided to write a little program that takes care of that for you. Don't worry, it doesn't delete any of your emails, only the downloaded version on your Mac.
